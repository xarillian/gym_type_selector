A little tool I used to distribute Pokemon types to friends. You can also use the command `--l` to output the remaining types following the distribution.

Example:
> Enter trainers (comma seperated):

> xarillian, this person

> xarillian, the Ice-type gym leader!

> this person, the Fire-type gym leader!
